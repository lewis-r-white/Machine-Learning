  rename(TA1 = TA1.x)

#read in the evaluation data

```{r}
#SPLITTING THE ORIGINAL TRAINING DATA INTO TRAINING DATA AND TEST DATA
set.seed(123)

dic_split <- initial_split(dic_data, prop = .80, strata = DIC) #sample size is just 1000, so I went with a 70% training 30% testing split
dic_train <- training(dic_split)
dic_test <- testing(dic_split)
```

```{r}
#check classes of variables 
lapply(dic_train, class) #all are numeric 
```

## Initial Linear model

We thought it would make sense to start things off with a linear model that included all the predictors. It seemed to perform pretty well!

```{r}
# Start with a linear regression model even though variables are highly correlated
lm <- lm(DIC ~ .-id, data = dic_train)

# Predict
lm_predictions <- predict(object = lm,
                          newdata = dic_test)
dic_test_lm <- cbind(dic_test, lm_predictions) # bind to data

# Find RMSE
sqrt(mean(lm$residuals^2))
rmse(dic_test_lm$DIC, dic_test_lm$lm_predictions)
```

## Regularized Regression

We then wanted to expand on the linear model and add in a coefficient penalty term. We tried ridge, lasso, and elastic net regularized regression. The lasso performed the best on the training/test data, but not as well as the initial linear model.

```{r}
## Setting up regularized regression 
X <- model.matrix(DIC ~ ., data = dic_train)[,-1] #compare DIC to all other predictors in the data. [,-1] removes the id variable

Y <- dic_train$DIC #assign DIC value to outcome vector Y

#fit a ridge model, passing X,Y,alpha to glmnet()
dic_ridge <- glmnet(x = X, 
                        y = Y, 
                        alpha = 0) #alpha = 0 indicates ridge regression 

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

plot(dic_ridge, xvar = "lambda")
title("Coefficient values as tuning parameter lambda increases", line = 3)

                          y = Y,

                          y = Y, 
                          alpha = 1,
                          nfolds = 10)

cv_dic_lasso$lambda.min


#ELASTIC NET REGRESSION 
cv_dic_elastic_net <- cv.glmnet(x = X, 
                                y = Y, 
                                alpha = 0.7,
                                nfolds = 10)

  tuneLength = 10

## KNN model

We also tried K-nearest neighbors for our model prediction. Again, this model did not perform as well as our initial linear regression. 

```{r label = "KNN Model Specification"}
# Specify the model
knn_spec <- nearest_neighbor(
  neighbors = tune(),
  weight_func = "optimal") |> 
  set_engine("kknn") |> 
  set_mode("regression")
```

```{r label = "KNN tuning grid"}
# Create tuning grid
# I tried up to 400 but the most neighbors in the best performing model never had more than 20 neighbors. 
knn_grid <- data.frame(neighbors = c(seq(1,50,1)))

```

```{r label = "KNN define workflow"}
# Define a workflow
knn_wf <- workflow() |> 
  add_model(knn_spec) |>
  add_recipe(original_recipe)
```

```{r label = "KNN model tune"}
# set seed
set.seed(456)

# Fit the workflow on our predefined folds and hyperparameters
knn_fit <- knn_wf |> 
  tune_grid(
    cv_folds, 
    grid = knn_grid # This is where the computational cost explodes.
  ) |> 
  select_best()
  

knn_fit
```

```{r label = "KNN tune model spec"}
# Specify the model
knn_spec <- nearest_neighbor(
  neighbors = knn_fit$neighbors,
  weight_func = "optimal") |> 
  set_engine("kknn") |> 
  set_mode("regression")
```

```{r label = "KNN create and fit workflow"}
knn_tune_wf <- workflow() |> 
  add_model(knn_spec) |> 
  add_recipe(original_recipe)

knn_final_wf <- fit(knn_tune_wf, dic_train)
``` 

```{r label = "generate predictions on the test data"}
#generate predictions

eval_pred <- predict(knn_final_wf, 
                     new_data = dic_test)

# bind back to dic_test
eval_data_pred <- cbind(dic_test, eval_pred) 

# assess rmse
eval_accuracy <- rmse(eval_data_pred, truth = DIC, estimate = .pred)

eval_accuracy
```

```{r label = "Create predictions on test"}

#generate predictions

eval_pred <- predict(knn_final_wf, 
                     new_data = dic_eval)

# bind back to dic_test
eval_data_pred <- cbind(dic_eval, eval_pred) |> 
  select(id, .pred) |> 
  rename("DIC" = .pred)
  

write_csv(eval_data_pred, "jel_KNN.csv")

```

## RANDOM FORESTS 

Up next: Random Forests. The tuning process took quite a long time to run and the model did not perform as well as our initial linear regression, so we decided to just comment out this code. 

```{r label = "Random Forest Model Specification"}
# # Specify the bagged tree model, use tune for all parameters. 
# random_forest_spec <- rand_forest(mode = "regression",
#                         mtry = tune(),          
#                         min_n = tune(),
#                         trees = tune(),
#                         ) |> 
#   set_engine("ranger")
```

```{r label = "Random forest workflow"}
# # Create random forest workflow 
# random_forest_wf <- workflow() |> 
#   add_recipe(original_recipe) |> 
#   add_model(random_forest_spec)
```

```{r label = "Random forest grid"}
# # create grid for random forest tuning parameters. 
# random_forest_grid <- 
#   grid_regular(
#     min_n(), 
#     trees(),
#     finalize(mtry(), select(dic_train, -DIC)),
#     levels = 25)
```

## BOOST 

Gradient boosting also provided evidence that a more complicated model isn't always a better one. Yet again, the initial linear regression outperformed boosting in terms of the RMSE value. 

```{r}
#SPLITTING THE ORIGINAL TRAINING DATA INTO TRAINING DATA AND TEST DATA

## FINAL MODEL: 

Because multiple linear regression was the most successful model, we decided to elaborate on that model by adding interaction terms based on our knowledge of ocean chemistry. For example, we interacted nutrients with depth because at different depths there are different levels of activity -- closer to the surface there are more photosynthesizers etc.

```{r}
#building the final model
lm_4 <- lm(DIC ~ Lat_Dec + Lon_Dec + NO2uM + NO3uM + NH3uM + R_TEMP + R_Depth + R_DYNHT + R_Nuts + R_Oxy_micromol.Kg + PO4uM + SiO3uM + TA1 + Salinity1 +  NO3uM * R_Depth + NO2uM * R_Depth + NH3uM * R_Depth + R_Nuts * R_Depth + SiO3uM * R_Depth + NO3uM * R_Oxy_micromol.Kg + NO2uM * R_Oxy_micromol.Kg + NH3uM * R_Oxy_micromol.Kg + R_Nuts * R_Oxy_micromol.Kg + SiO3uM * R_Oxy_micromol.Kg + TA1 * Salinity1 + TA1 * R_Nuts + R_TEMP * Salinity1, data = dic_train)

# Predict
lm_predictions_4 <- predict(object = lm_4,
                          newdata = dic_test)
dic_test_lm_4 <- cbind(dic_test, lm_predictions_4) # bind to data

# Find RMSE
sqrt(mean(lm_4$residuals^2))
rmse(dic_test_lm_4$DIC, dic_test_lm_4$lm_predictions_4)

lm_eval_4 <- predict(object = lm_4,
                   newdata = dic_eval)

  select(id, lm_eval_4) %>%
