# Machine-Learning

This repository was created to document assignments and in-class activities for a machine learning course. 

Course description:
* Machine learning is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that ‘learn’, that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. In this course, we focus on the core concepts of machine learning that beginning ML researchers must know. We cover ‘classical machine learning’ primarily using R, and explore applications to environmental science. To understand broader concepts of artificial intelligence or deep learning, a strong fundamental knowledge of machine learning is indispensable.

We focused on the following topics in this course:

1. Linear Regression and ML Modeling Fundamentals
2. Linear Regression and ML Modeling Fundamentals
3. Regularized Regression
4. Logistic Regression, Classification
5. K-nearest Neighbors
6. Decision Trees
7. Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)
8. Random Forests
9. Gradient Boosting
10.	Clustering
11. Kaggle
12. Ethics, Justice, Bias
